# Intro

gettext-mini is a clone of gettext-tiny but made with autotools.

** PROJECT STATUS: unstable, porting in progress **

Original source: https://github.com/AdelieLinux/gettext-tiny

Just like gettext-tiny, this is a lightweight replacement for GNU's
`gettext`, which is incredibly bloated and takes a lot of time to 
build (in the order of an hour on slow devices). The most notable 
component is `msgfmt` which is used to create binary translation files 
in the .mo format out of textual input files in .po format. this is 
the most important tool for building software from source, because 
it is used from the build processes of many software packages.

Unlike the GNU implementation of `msgfmt`, this project's implementation
can expand input strings containing so-called sysdep strings into a 
constant translation table. sysdep strings were glued as an 
after-thought onto the GNU implementation to deal with system-specific 
format strings, and in the GNU implementation those are created at 
runtime, which requires mapping the entire .mo file into read/write 
memory locations, thereby wasting precious RAM for read-only data 
that could otherwise be shared among processes. 

Other parts of gettext-mini such as xgettext and msgmerge are still 
stubs, but they are sufficient to build many packages.

This project is geared for musl libc, so `libintl` will be a compat
library providing a few compatibility symbols meant to be used 
together with the libintl built-in into recent musl versions. the 
compatibility symbols help to get past configure scripts that 
insist on using only the GNU gettext suite. additionally, it can 
be entirely disabled.
